✅ 1. PMF (Probability Mass Function)
📝 Easy Definition:
PMF is used for countable things (discrete numbers).

It gives exact probability of a value happening.

📌 Example:
🎲 In a dice roll,

P(x=3) = 1/6​
 
This means, chance of getting 3 = 1 out of 6.

PMF tells “what is the chance of getting a particular number”.


✅ 2. PDF (Probability Density Function)
📝 Easy Definition:
PDF is used for uncountable things (continuous numbers).

It gives the shape of probability but not exact point chance.

You get chance by taking area under curve.

📌 Example:
🎯 Height of people:
You can’t say “what is the chance of being exactly 170.5 cm” (it’s 0).
But you can say,
“chance of height between 170 and 180 cm = area under PDF curve”.



✅ 3. CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function)
📝 Easy Definition:
CDF shows total chance from the starting point up to any value.

It keeps adding probability till that point.

📌 Example:
🎲 Dice roll:

 (X≤4)=P(1)+P(2)+P(3)+P(4)= 4/6
​

🌧️ Rainfall example (continuous):

Area from 0 to 50 mm
P(X≤50 mm)=Area from 0 to 50 mm
