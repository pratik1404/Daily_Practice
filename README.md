# 📘 Daily Data Analysis Practice by Pratik Patil

Welcome to my learning journey!

I've committed to practicing **Data Analysis with Python** every single day — no breaks, no excuses. This repository documents my progress, experiments, learnings, and code snippets as I build my way toward becoming a skilled data analyst.

---

## 🚀 Why I Started This Journey

- To **master Python** and its data stack
- To become **job-ready for analyst roles** 
- To build a **real, honest portfolio** of what I’ve actually learned
- To stay **consistent** and track growth day by day

---

## 📅 Daily Practice Routine

Every day, I:
- Learn one or more concepts from Python or Data Analysis
- Practice it through notebooks and examples
- Document the day’s learning with code and explanations
- Push everything here, raw and real

> This is not a polished tutorial — this is the **behind-the-scenes** of becoming job-ready.

---

## 🧠 What I’ve Covered So Far

- Core Python: variables, collections, functions, error handling, and more
- Functional Programming: `lambda`, `map()`, `filter()`, etc.
- Data Tools: NumPy and Pandas basics (arrays, Series, DataFrames, missing values)
- Real-life examples and use cases
- Statistiics Part:-
  * Statisctics basic fundamentals
  * Descriptive Statistics

## 📈 My Goals

- 🏆 Build confidence in practical Python and data workflows
- 📊 Get interview-ready for data analyst roles
- 🧾 Create a base for future advanced tools like Power BI, SQL, and ML
- ✨ Make this a portfolio of **real progress**, not just completed tutorials

---

## 💼 Tools I Use

- Python 3.10+
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- NumPy, Pandas
- VS Code, Git, GitHub
- Soon: Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQL, Power BI
