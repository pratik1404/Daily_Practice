/*
ðŸ”¹ Use When?
Use UNION when combining similar result sets (like logs from two years).

Use FULL OUTER JOIN when you need a complete picture from both tables and want to see all matches and non-matches.



ðŸŸ¦ UNION
1) Combines rows from two tables.

2) Tables must have the same number of columns.

3) Think of it like copy-pasting rows from one table below the other.

4) Removes duplicates (use UNION ALL to keep them).


ðŸŸª FULL OUTER JOIN
â€¢ Combines columns from two tables.

â€¢ Keeps all rows from both tables.

â€¢ If there's no match, it shows NULL for missing parts.
